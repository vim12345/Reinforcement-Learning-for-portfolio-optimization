# Reinforcement-Learning-for-portfolio-optimization

# Description:
In finance, portfolio optimization involves allocating capital across assets to maximize return and minimize risk. RL can be applied to learn dynamic investment strategies that adapt to market conditions over time. The agent receives price changes and decides how to rebalance its portfolio at each step.

In this project, we simulate a simple 2-asset market where an RL agent learns to adjust investment weights based on historical price movements to optimize cumulative return.

# âœ… What It Does:
* Simulates a market with two assets (different volatilities).

* Learns how to reallocate capital to maximize returns.

* Uses Q-learning with discretized state space (price relatives).

* Foundation for applying RL to real stock data, crypto portfolios, or multi-asset ETFs.
